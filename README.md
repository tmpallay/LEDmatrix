# LEDmatrix
Simple Arduino code for a 6x6 LED matrix

The pdf file shows the schematic that I created for this project. Resistors of varying values were used because I had both green and yellow LEDs in the design. Green LEDs have a 15k Ohm series resistor connected with their cathode, while yellow LEDs have a 1k Ohm. Beside each bank of connected anodes and cathodes, there is also a designator that shows what digital pin the bank is connected to (genuine Arduino UNO).
